# Logo Setup Instructions

## To use your custom logo:

1. **Save your logo image** as `logo.png` in the `assets/images/` folder
2. **Recommended size**: 200x200 pixels or larger (square format works best)
3. **Format**: PNG with transparent background preferred

## File location:
```
devpath/
└── assets/
    └── images/
        └── logo.png  ← Place your logo here
```

## What the app will do:
- Display your logo on the splash screen with a beautiful animation
- Use it as the app icon throughout the interface
- Apply rounded corners and shadow effects automatically

## Current setup:
The app is already configured to look for `assets/images/logo.png` and will display it with:
- 140x140 pixel size
- Rounded corners (35px radius)
- Beautiful shadow effect
- Smooth scale and fade animations

Once you place your logo file, the app will automatically use it instead of the generated SVG!
